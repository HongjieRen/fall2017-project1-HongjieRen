### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2017

+ Projec title: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
+ This project is conducted by Hongjie Ren

+ Project summary: This project mainly focus on exploring the difference between the president inauguration speech and farewell speech. Both on the history perspective and individual perspective. We find that though president's speech style doesn't change much, they do have some slight emotional changes in the two kinds of speeches.
